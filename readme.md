# Express Form Validation with Express-Validator

This project is built to learn and demonstrate form validation and data sanitization using `express-validator` with `Express` and `EJS`. It includes validation for user input fields like `first name`, `last name`, and a search functionality.

## Features

- **Form Validation**: Ensures that user inputs meet required criteria.
  - First Name: Must be non-empty and contain only letters.
  - Last Name: Must be non-empty and contain only letters.
- **Data Sanitization**: Cleans the user input for safety.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for records in the system based on certain criteria.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering views.
- **express-validator**: Middleware for validating and sanitizing inputs.
